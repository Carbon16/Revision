# Physics Index

This is the physics index. Most (all) of the physics notes are one one note. This will mainly just be for keeping track of work & results & stuff.

## Plan
- [ ] Work throught the past papers on onenote (1)
- [ ] Do the topic specific revision for weak area
- [ ] Do the AIS resouces

## Weak areas
- [ ] Moments, specifically how to calculate the weight of the lever
- [ ] Electostatics
- [ ] Need to reference closeley to sources
- [ ] Specific heat capacity & latency
- [ ] Read graphs carefully!
- [ ] Optics
