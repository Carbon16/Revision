# Physics Index

This is the physics index. Most (all) of the physics notes are one one note. This will mainly just be for keeping track of work & results & stuff.

## Plan
- [x] Work throught the past papers on onenote (1)
- [ ] Do the topic specific revision for weak area
- [ ] Do the AIS resouces

## Weak areas
- [x] Moments, specifically how to calculate the weight of the lever
- [x] Electostatics
- [x] Need to reference closeley to sources
- [x] Specific heat capacity & latency
- [x] Read graphs carefully!
- [x] Optics

## Sessions
1.  [12.02.22](12.02.22.md)
2. [15.02.22](15.02.22.md)
