### Marks Dropped
* Q1A: Did not convert binary properly
* Q3B: Said backup instead of security option e.g 2FA 
* Q4: Need to revise key terms and microprocessors etc.
* Q6A(iv): Did not elaborate on consequences of not compressing as much
* Q7A: Parity
* Q7B: Parity
* Q7Ci: Did not metion all MS points

### Q by Q
* Q1: 4/5
    - Revise bin etc.
    - IP can be changed, MAC cannot (well it can buuuut)
    - IP has 4/8 groups or values
    - IP is 32-bit/64-bit
    - IP does not contain Serial/Manufacturer
    - IP is denary, MAC is Hex
* Q2: 12/12
* Q3: 8/9
    - 2FA
    - MFA
    - Secure passwords
    - Biometrics
* Q4: 6/8
    - Sensor send data/readings/signal to MicroPro
    - Data is converted from analogue to digital (ADC)
    - Microprocessor checks data to stored ranges
    - If data > 30 sends **signal** to turn off heater and to open window
    - If data < 25 sends **signal** to turn on heater and close windows
    - If data is in range then no action
    - Actuator used
    - Whole process is continuous
* Q5: 10/10
* Q6: 13/14
    - Need to fully develop points
    - Need to explain consequences of not using losless
    - W/P all lengthy answers
* Q7: 4/11
    - Parity
    - Illegible
    - Both directions
    - Only one at a time
    - **Multiple wires**
* Q8: 7/11
    - ==Binary & Hex==
* Q9: 0/5
    - **Structure:**
        - Placment of text/images
        - Padding
        - Margins
        - Line breaks
    - **Presentation:**
        - Color
        - Font
        - Image size
        - Class
        - Properties
    - **Part 2**
        - Easily change syle of the webpage
        - CSS can be used to create a style sheet
        - Can add new content and apply the same style
        - Can re-use the presentation/style for other websites
