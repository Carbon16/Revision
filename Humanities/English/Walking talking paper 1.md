Answer

The explorers dautghter is about a girl who stays with the Inghuit people and her moral conflict while watching a hunt. The hungry cyclist is about a cyclist who is on a cultural tour and discovers a new kind of local delicacy. Both texts cover an outsiders view of cultural delicacies and practice.

Both texts are about a cultural food or practices that are juxtaposed to British and western culture. For example, in the hungry cyclist the narrator describes how he had a ‘persistent interest’ in the cultural food and his passion for the delicacy made him a new friend who ‘invited him to lunch’. The writer also describes how Guinea pigs (Cûr) is sold in pet shops in Britain, showing the difference in use for the animals; one culture uses them for food, ‘medicine’ and tradition, the other for pets. Likewise in the explorers daughter the writer describes how hunters need a great deal of skill in order to catch the food they need to survive. However she debates the morality of the hunt, saying she was on the side of both ‘the hunter and the narwhal’. This internal conflict shows how the narrator is uneasy with a cultural practice that has been used for centuries.

However, one difference between the texts is that the landscape in the explorers daughter is described as beautiful, pure and untouched, a ‘glittering kingdom’. However in the hungry cyclist, the surroundings are described as having ‘buses’ and ‘potholes’, something which is juxtaposed to the unspoilt beauty of Greenland. While one landscape is developed, the other is sparkiling and untouched.
