# 4EA1/01R - Tuesday 5 June 2018
([[#Plan for 5]])

1. "On top of the world", "Switzerland sized nation"
2. The witer explores parts of bhutan and it's tiny towns. The author comments on how the towns have remained unchanged since it was first explored. The writers familliarity with old texts about bhutan indicates that she has reaserched it's past and has a strong interest in it. The writer also explores the more rural areas of bhutan, and describes how beautiful the area is. She also visits a world famous temple, and is in awe of how it allmost seems to be fantasy. The writer also watches some traditional practices and even participates in archery.
3. We learn that the author views the hotels she is staying in as 'treating her like royalty'. This shows us that the bhutanese people are very accomadating and hospitable. We also learn that the hotels have incredibly high standards, just like in 'Tokyo or Venice'. This shows us that while bhutan may be behind the rest of the world in terms of development, it is certainly not behind in terms of hospitality. We also learn that the bhutanes hotels have a wide range of international food. The author describes how they eat enything 'from smoked salmon and tender Australian rib-eye steak to Bhutanese feasts coloured with chillies'. This shows us how while bhutan may be islated from the rest of the world, it must have sufficient trade connections to be able to source 'australian' food. Finally, we learn that the guides are very protective and that the bhutanes people are very polite, if not kind. We know this as she describes the people at the hotel as having 'sweet smiles' and her drivers as being 'kind hosts'. This may show the collective bhutanes pride in their nation.
4. **In what ways does the writer use language and structure to convey her impressions of Bhutan?**:
    In *beyond the sky and earth*, the writer uses a number of techiques to convey her impressions of bhutan. One such structural technique is using short sentances to empahises her point of how mountainous bhutan is. The author describes how 'Bhutan is all and only mountains.' This assertion of the authors view indicates how clearly she views this statment, and leads the reader to beleive that there must be no exceptions to this fact. ==///== The writer also descibes the landscape as appearing as if it had been shaped 'by a child'. The use of the word 'child' may be intended to indicate to the reader that the landscape appears to be random, and made at the will of a being with no purpose other then curiosity. The use of the word 'child' may also reflect on how the author views bhutan with childlike curiosity and wonder, as well as it being unfamilliar. ==///== The author also descibes the view from her ''simple, pine-paneled room". Here the author contrasts her 'simple' hotel room with the view of "mountains rise\[ing\] to meet  the moon." This contrasts hilights how although the county may seem 'simple' to the people who visit it; it is anything but ugly. This choice of contrast may be interended to show the reader how the bhutanses may have simple surroundings, but their enviroment and country are anything but.
5. The two texts are about a similar topic, however there are a few contrasting and very similar points. While *beyond the sky and earth* is written to inform the reader about the writers experiences of teaching and initial impresssions of the area, the other text is intended to review Bhutan for the purpose of a trave guide. This difference means that one will only descibe the culture and experience from a guests and workers point of view, while the other will descibe it with a paying customer's perspecitve.
    However they are similar in another way, as they are both very impressed by the landscape and the people.
