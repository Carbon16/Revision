### Answer
There are a number of causes for the shift in employment sectors, however most notaibly in the primary sector there is a massive shift in the proportion of workers. This shift is clearly displayed in the figure 1C, with primary sector work previously being the highest proportion of workers, at 70% in the pre-industrial era, down to now only 10% in the post-indistrail. This is most likley to be becuase the jobs wich previously took many people a long time to do in the primary sector can now be accomplished by just one, due the increased mechansiation of farming equipment.

A cause for the beggining of the quaternary sector after the industrial period could be that there is now a much larger focus on reaserch and development of new products and medicine. Additionaly in developed countrires the quaterniary jobs are likley to be higher paying, and more demanding of education. Because of this, these jobs cannot be outsourced to cheaper countries and must be done in more developed, more educated countries
